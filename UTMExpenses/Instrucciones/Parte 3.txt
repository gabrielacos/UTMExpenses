Part 3: Process design (Value of this part is about 25% of project)
1. User interface:

a. Validate user input, both when adding and modifying records.

b. Provide for logically navigating between windows using a navigation bar on
the top. Pre-selection of records before displaying a new screen would be
convenient.

c. Implement provisions to facilitate data entry (i.e. default values, special
input controls, data-bound drop-down lists)

d. Provide for selecting a group of records or a specific record in each window.
When dealing with master/detail windows, you may want to automatically
display in the detail window the record selected in the master window, if
any.

e. Confirm sensitive operations (i.e. record deletion, values entered).

f. Provide a nice format to all displayed data, particularly to data columns (i.e.
decimal places, alignment, descriptive column titles). (You may want to
leave this for the very end.)

2. User and Log Management

a. Authenticate the user at login and validate that the user is logged on every page.
b. Use the stored procedure (provided by the professor) to write to the UTMLog
table every action; ie. insert, update and delete on each table, and user login.

3. Database management:

a. Update the database properly.

b. Provide for checking referential integrity rules at the user interface level. (An
appropriate user interface will reduce the probability of violating these
rules. For example, automatically entering the values for foreign keys or
providing a combo box to select them.)

4. Calculations:
a. Calculate columns which must be automatically calculated, if any.
b. Provide totals for displayed records, where applicable. For example, record
count and column totals.

1) Inactive records must not be considered for totaling purposes.
c. Do not allow any transactions on sons of inactive parents. (Optional)
